# pdb-automation
This repo has my script for fixing and editing PDB files.  
I might add more later.

## `renumber_chain.py`

This script fixes residue numbering in PDB files by renumbering a selected chain starting from a specified index (e.g., 67).  
Useful when PDB files contain issues like negative, duplicated, or nonstandard residue numbers.
